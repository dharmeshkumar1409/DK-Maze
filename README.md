Hi there, I'm Dharmesh ðŸ‘‹

## This is a maze game where you have to complete it without touching lava(or you can say obstacle) which is red in color.
- If you touch the first blue color box, your ball's color will change to random color(you can touch as many times you want till you are satisfied with the color you obtained and you can move ahead).
- The second blue color box will open the mysterious way ahead. The pink color box is a bounce pad, on which you can bounce to reach the high platform.
- The dim blue color is water.
- The yellow box is the finish line.
- Enjoy!!!
